## Demo Plan
For hackathon purposes, a **mini-demo** can be implemented as follows:

1. **Robotic arm** handling 5–10 sample medications.  
2. **AI camera** identifying and sorting medications correctly.  
3. **Offline AI triage** simulating patient symptom input → preliminary diagnosis.  
4. **Mock remote doctor** approving prescriptions.  
5. **Smart queue simulation** for multiple patients.  
6. **Dashboard** displaying live dispensing and patient interaction logs.

## Technologies Used
- Robotics: Arduino / Raspberry Pi / ROS2  
- AI: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV (for vision)  
- Backend: Rust / Python (FastAPI or Actix)  
- Frontend: React / Next.js for dashboard  
- Offline AI Model: TensorFlow Lite / ONNX  
- Telehealth Video: WebRTC / Twilio API  
- Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite (offline capable)
