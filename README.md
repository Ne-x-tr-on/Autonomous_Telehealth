# Autonomous Telehealth Smart Hub 🤖🏥

## Project Overview
The **Autonomous Telehealth Smart Hub** is a fully integrated robotic healthcare system designed to provide **accessible, safe, and efficient medical services** to patients in both urban and rural areas. This system combines **robotics, AI, computer vision, offline intelligence, telehealth integration, and smart queue management** to deliver medications accurately while connecting patients with remote healthcare professionals.

---

## Objective
The primary aim of the project is to **bridge the gap between patients and healthcare services** by:

- Automating medication dispensing with high accuracy.  
- Ensuring patient privacy and safety.  
- Enabling remote doctor consultations.  
- Reducing queues and wait times at healthcare facilities.  
- Operating even in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.  

This system targets **hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and rural healthcare centers** that face shortages of medical personnel or infrastructure.

## Key Features

### 1. Robotic Medication Dispensing
- Robotic arm automatically retrieves and dispenses prescribed medications.  
- Reduces human error and improves patient safety.  
- Can handle multiple prescriptions simultaneously.  

### 2. AI Camera Sorting System
- Uses computer vision to identify and sort medicines in real-time.  
- Corrects misplaced or interchanged medications automatically.  
- Ensures precise inventory management.

### 3. Offline AI Health Triage
- AI system diagnoses preliminary symptoms locally without internet.  
- Provides prescription suggestions based on patient history and inputs.  
- Syncs data with central servers when connectivity is available.  

### 4. Smart Queue Management
- Allows patients to book appointments via mobile app, USSD, or kiosk.  
- Predicts waiting times and guides patients efficiently.  
- Reduces overcrowding in clinics and hospitals.

### 5. Remote Doctor Integration
